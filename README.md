# TicTacToe
TicTacToe related programs and AIs. Dependent on one another.

## RoteAI
A program built with a knowledge of how to win TTT. It cannot lose under any circumstances. It goes first, and follows a very complex tree of evaluations.

However, I wrote it a long time ago. It is not at all modular, and can only run on its own. It's now essentially legacy code that may be used in a later version of the AI that is modular. It may be resurrected.
